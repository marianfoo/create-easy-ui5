### Issue Reporting Disclaimer

We want to improve the quality of the UI5 Communtiy projects and good bug reports are welcome! But keep in mind that this here is spare-time work and thus the capacity is limited.

Therefore, we reserve the right to close or to not process insufficient bug reports in favor of those which are clearly documented and easy to reproduce. Even though we would like to solve each well-documented issue, there is always the chance that it won't happen - please remember: The UI5 Community projects are Open Source and comes without warranty.

Bug report analysis support is always very welcome! See [Analyze Issues](#-analyzing-issues).

#### Requirements

The technical requirements to contribute to the project are the following:

- A current version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

#### Getting Started

To get started contributing to this project you need to do the following steps:

- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install`

#### Commit Messages format

This project enforces the [conventional-commits][conventional_commits] commit message formats.
The possible commits types prefixes are limited to those defined by [conventional-commit-types][commit_types].
This promotes a clean project history and enabled automatically generating a changelog.

The commit message format will be inspected both on a git pre-commit hook
and during the central CI build and will **fail the build** if issues are found.

#### Formatting

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used for some of the sub-packages to do a proper code formatting. The formatting is running as part of the `pre-commit` hook.

#### Compiling

This project is implemented using plain ECMAScript without any compilation / transpilation steps.

#### Testing

npm start
```

## üì¶ Release Package

This repository uses [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to manage the release process.

### Release Process

First, make sure that you pull the latest state of the GitHub repository and then proceed with the following steps:

1. Update the version: `npm version patch|minor|major`
2. Update the changelog: `npm run changelog`, commit and amend the version change from step 1: `git add . && git commit --amend --no-edit`
3. Push the new commit and tag: `git push origin --tags`
4. Inspect the newly artifacts published on npmjs.com.

A GitHub action will do the needful once the new tag has been pushed.

### Upgrading the version of the dependencies

To upgrade the version of the dependencies the NPM package `npm-check-updates` is used. The following code snippets shows how to use it:

```bash
# install the npm-check-updates
npm install -g npm-check-updates

# check for dependencies to be updated
ncu

# update the dependencies automatically
ncu -u
```

Be careful with major version changes of the dependencies as this might cause additional work to make the package running again.
